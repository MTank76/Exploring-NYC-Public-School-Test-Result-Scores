# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores
This project focuses on analyzing the SAT performance of public high schools in New York City. The SAT (Scholastic Assessment Test) is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It assesses students' literacy, numeracy, and writing skills across three sections: reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points.

## Objective

The analysis aims to answer three key questions regarding SAT performance across NYC public schools. This information is crucial for various stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government agencies, and parents, as it helps them understand educational outcomes and make informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is named `schools.csv`. It contains data on SAT scores across different public high schools in NYC. The data includes information on reading, math, and writing scores, along with other relevant school details.

## Analysis Questions

The project aims to answer the following key questions:
1. What is the overall SAT performance across NYC public schools?
2. Are there significant disparities in SAT scores across different schools or demographics?
3. How do various factors, such as school size or location, influence SAT performance?

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Key Steps

1. **Data Exploration:** Understanding the dataset and checking for missing or inconsistent data.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Cleaning the data to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the SAT scores and identifying trends, patterns, and disparities.
4. **Visualization:** Creating visual representations of the data to effectively communicate findings.

## Results and Insights

The analysis provides insights into the overall SAT performance of NYC public schools, highlights disparities across different demographics, and explores factors influencing SAT scores.
